# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Mission

This is a **multi-plugin marketplace** for Claude Code. The main plugin `ac` turns Claude Code into a structured development partner with plan-first workflows, specialized agents with model routing, and a skill creator. The marketplace structure allows additional plugins to be added independently.

All components are pure markdown with YAML frontmatter. No compiled code.

**Marketplace vs Plugin boundary**: Root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is the catalog — it lists all plugins with `"source": "./plugins/<name>"`. Each plugin has its own `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (minimal: name, description, author). Heavy metadata (version, category, homepage, tags) lives only in marketplace.json.

## Commands (ac plugin)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ac:plan` | Classify → research (with CLAUDE.md + my-coding context extraction) → dynamic convergence interview (≤20% ambiguity) → pre-generation analysis → plan (with QA scenarios, required Conventions section, mandatory Deep Review for Complex) |
| `/ac:execute` | Execute approved plan with project context propagation (PLAN_CONVENTIONS + RUNTIME_CONTEXT → worker prompts, convention-aware verification) → Complexity-driven Verification Wave + Codebase State tier escalation |
| `/ac:init-claude-md` | Generate or enhance project CLAUDE.md — auto-discovers codebase, interviews developer, preserves custom sections |
| `/ac:init-rules` | Auto-generate `.claude/rules/` from project analysis |
| `/ac:setup-coding` | Analyze projects → interview → generate `my-coding` skill |
| `/ac:setup-language` | Interactive writing style analyzer — scans existing content, interviews developer, generates my-language skill |
| `/ac:setup-global-claude-md` | Generate global CLAUDE.md — interviews developer, detects skills, produces orchestration config |
| `/ac:commit` | Smart commit — preflight checks, convention detection, atomic commits. Delegates to git-master when available |
| `/ac:ideate` | Idea refinement — Socratic interview, ambiguity scoring, adversarial challenge, task generation. Supports `--bulk` and `--loop` |
| `/ac:work` | Ad-hoc parallel execution — decompose request into independent tasks, route to model tiers, fire simultaneously, complexity-driven verification |
| `/ac:browser-qa` | Browser QA testing — ad-hoc tests, bug reproduction, plan verification. Auto-detects Playwright CLI |
| `/ac:progress` | Show execution progress — active plans, task status, next action |

## Agents (ac plugin)

| Agent | `subagent_type` | NOT | Model | Effort | Color | Role | Tools |
|-------|-----------------|-----|-------|--------|-------|------|-------|

All agents are read-only. No write tools on advisory roles. All agents enforce `disallowedTools: Write, Edit` as defense-in-depth. Always use the `ac:` prefixed `subagent_type` — builtin `Explore` and `explore` route to different agents.

## Skills & MCP

### ac plugin
- `ac-skill-creator` (Opus) — Create or improve Claude Code extension components. Has `references/` with templates
- `ac:browser-qa` skill (Sonnet, not user-invocable) — Browser QA workflow patterns and `playwright-cli` command routing. Has references/ for report format and evidence schema. Requires Playwright CLI (`npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest`)
- MCP: `context7` (user-installed) — Live documentation API via `@upstash/context7-mcp`
- MCP: `gemini-cli` (optional, user-installed, npm: gemini-mcp-tool) — Gemini CLI bridge for multimodal, large context, brainstorm. **Usage rule**: Always pass content inline to `ask-gemini` — never use `@filepath` for files outside the project workspace (Gemini cannot read them). Gemini is a supplementary "second eye", not the primary analyzer — Opus agents do the main analysis

### github-cli plugin
- `github-cli` (Sonnet) — gh patterns for issues, PRs, releases, actions, gh api (REST + GraphQL), scripting

### git-master plugin
- `git-master` (Sonnet) — Atomic commits with style detection, rebase/squash, history archaeology

### frontend-design plugin
- `frontend-design` (Sonnet) — Production-grade UI for web and mobile with design systems and visual hierarchy. Has `references/`

### dart-lsp plugin
- LSP plugin — Dart/Flutter language server via `dart language-server`. Configured via `lspServers` inline in `marketplace.json` (no skills, no commands). Activates go-to-definition, find references, hover, and `<new-diagnostics>` for `.dart` files.

### json-lsp plugin
- LSP plugin — JSON language server via `vscode-json-languageserver`. Schema validation, hover, and diagnostics for `.json` and `.jsonc` files. Binary: `npm install -g vscode-langservers-extracted`.

### yaml-lsp plugin
- LSP plugin — YAML language server via `yaml-language-server`. Schema validation, hover, and diagnostics for `.yaml` and `.yml` files. Binary: `npm install -g yaml-language-server`.

### markdown-lsp plugin
- LSP plugin — Markdown language server via `marksman`. Link navigation, find references, and document symbols for `.md` and `.mdx` files. Binary: `brew install marksman`.

### Browser Testing (Playwright CLI)

Playwright CLI is required for browser QA testing. Install globally:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
```

The `/ac:browser-qa` command auto-detects the CLI at runtime. No MCP server needed — all browser interactions use shell commands via `playwright-cli`.

## Design Principles

- **Multi-plugin marketplace**: Root is the catalog, each plugin is self-contained under `plugins/<name>/`
- **Model routing**: Haiku (search/fast), Sonnet (execution/analysis), Opus (planning/architecture/creation). Workers get per-step model based on tier (quick→Haiku, mid→Sonnet, senior→Opus) with auto-escalation on failure
- **Agent model customization**: Explore (default Haiku) and Librarian (default Sonnet) — override via Claude Code's native `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` / `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` env vars. Model profiles: `quality` (all Opus) / `balanced` (default — Haiku/Sonnet/Opus per frontmatter) / `budget` (Sonnet+Haiku only) — configure via env vars
- **Progressive disclosure**: Metadata always loaded → SKILL.md body on trigger → references/ on demand
- **Read-only advisory**: Agents that advise never have write tools
- **Plan-first**: All commands follow classify → research → interview → generate → review → install
- **reliability-first**: Right model for right task — default Sonnet execution, Opus for planning/investigation/architecture
- **Foreground-first agent synchronization**: Parallel agents that must all complete before proceeding use foreground (default) — CC waits for all automatically. Background (`run_in_background: true`) only for genuinely independent work; when all agents have reported, proceed. Verification agents are always foreground. All parallel Agent calls must be in a single message block.
- **Complexity-driven verification**: Verification depth scales with plan complexity — Simple (build+test only), Standard (code-reviewer + linter, skip Opus verifier), Complex (full 3-agent wave, mandatory — cannot be bypassed by --loop or any flag). Build+test and verification agents launch as foreground in a single message block. Commit preflight skipped via `--skip-preflight` when invoked by execute post-verification.
- **Pre-generation analysis**: Metis-inspired gap detection — plan-analysis agent runs in pre-generation mode to catch hidden intentions and AI-slop risks before plan writing. Post-gen analysis runs in parallel with Deep Review (plan-review) — mandatory for Complex, opt-in for Standard.
- **Subagent-only architecture**: All agents use subagent model (fresh context, custom model/tools). Fork model (inherits parent context + prompt cache) is cheaper but requires `model: inherit` (breaks model routing) and `tools: ['*']` (breaks read-only advisory). Use fork only when child needs full parent context AND same model AND no tool restriction
- **Conditional MCP routing**: Agents detect MCP tool availability at runtime — graceful fallback when tools not installed. All MCP servers are user-installed, not bundled
- **Project-local storage**: Plans saved to `.ac/plans/`, tasks to `.ac/tasks/`, QA evidence to `.ac/qa/` in the working directory. Not gitignored by default — each project decides
- **Auto commit+push**: Orchestrators (execute, ideate) invoke `/ac:commit` after task completion to commit and push changes
- **Ad-hoc parallel execution**: `/ac:work` provides plan-free parallel execution for multi-file tasks. Decomposes requests into independent tasks with file ownership validation, routes each to correct model tier (quick→Haiku, mid→Sonnet, senior→Opus), fires simultaneously, and runs complexity-driven verification. For structured multi-step work with dependencies, use `/ac:plan` + `/ac:execute` instead
- **Project context propagation**: Subagents don't receive CLAUDE.md by design (CC's `userContext: {}` for subagents). ac compensates with a hybrid extraction pipeline:
  - **Plan-time** (`plan.md`): Reads CLAUDE.md + CLAUDE.local.md + `.claude/rules/` + `my-coding` skill → extracts into `PROJECT_CONTEXT` → merges into plan's `### Conventions` section (required)
  - **Execute-time** (`execute.md`): Reads CLAUDE.md fresh → extracts build/test/lint commands + gotchas as `RUNTIME_CONTEXT` (deduplicated against `PLAN_CONVENTIONS`) → injected into worker prompts (compact for quick tier, full for mid/senior)
  - **Verification-time** (`execute.md` Phase 5): `PLAN_CONVENTIONS` + `RUNTIME_CONTEXT` passed to code-reviewer and verifier agent prompts for convention compliance checking
  - **Ideation-time** (`ideate.md`): Reads CLAUDE.md → extracts as `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS` → injected into challenger and feasibility agent prompts
  - **Codebase State**: Plan classifies target area (Disciplined/Transitional/Legacy/Chaotic) → execute uses for tier escalation (Chaotic/Legacy auto-escalates quick→mid)

## Adding a New Plugin

**Skill/command plugin** (github-cli, git-master, frontend-design pattern):
1. Create `plugins/<name>/` with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (name, description, author)
2. Add commands/, agents/, skills/ as needed
3. Add entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `"source": "./plugins/<name>"`
4. Add README.md and LICENSE

**LSP plugin** (dart-lsp pattern):
1. Create `plugins/<name>/` with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, README.md, LICENSE
2. Add entry in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` with `"strict": false` and `"lspServers"` inline — no `.lsp.json` file

## Gotchas

- No test infrastructure — pure markdown plugin, verify manually via `claude plugin add ./`
- Commands use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` for template paths — set by Claude Code at runtime to the plugin's actual directory
- Commands delegate to `ac-skill-creator` for file generation — they don't write files directly
- Plugin-level `plugin.json` is minimal (3 fields) — version, category, tags live only in root `marketplace.json`
- CC subagents receive `userContext: {}` (no CLAUDE.md) by design — ac's context propagation pipeline compensates by extracting and injecting project rules at plan/execute/verify time via prompt variables (PROJECT_CONTEXT, PLAN_CONVENTIONS, RUNTIME_CONTEXT)
